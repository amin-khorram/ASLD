American Sign Language dataset classification
The American Sign Language alphabet contains 26 letters. Two of those letters (j and z) require movement, so they are not included in the training dataset.![Screenshot (208)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96221851/205549582-bc549948-ff3c-4cc0-8126-bddd9010b138.png)
I have writtten a simple deep learning algorithm to classify this dataset.
It was the Nvidia deep learning workshop's assignment.
